colorscheme
    very basic color scheme for sublime text. although, it 
    shouldn't be too hard to make a version for other programs.
    the colors are pretty much five:
    
    light:
        - foreground : #142850
        - background : #F5EFE6
        - alternative: #8785A2
        - comment    : #1FAB89
        - error      : #B83B5E
        
    the dark variant only swaps background with foreground.
    
    dark:
        - foreground : #F5EFE6
        - background : #142850
        - alternative: #8785A2
        - comment    : #1FAB89
        - error      : #B83B5E
    
    the alternative color is used for less important things, 
    such as, line number.

demo
    check https://github.com/Ruk33/colorscheme/blob/master/light.jpg and 
    https://github.com/Ruk33/colorscheme/blob/master/dark.jpg
    
    the font used is called NSimSun.

how to install?
    copy both files in %APPDATA%/Sublime Text/Packages/User.
    after that, both color scheme themes should appear as 
    "SimplerTimes (light)" and "SimplerTimes (dark)"

why no colors?
    you know, after trying it out, i found it's way less
    distracting to have fewer colors. also, i have noticed 
    that many color schemes don't highlight comments as
    much as it should. it's a comment, something is important,
    that should be highlighted as much as possible.
